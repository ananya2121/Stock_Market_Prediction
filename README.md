# Stock_Market_Prediction
Overview
This project contains the implementation of various machine learning models for stock market prediction. We have utilized different models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting Tree, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest. The prediction analysis is based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value.
Models Implemented
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Utilizes a feedforward neural network to learn patterns in the data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Applies convolutional layers to learn spatial hierarchies in the input data.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A classic neural network architecture with multiple layers.
Gradient Boosting Tree: Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes or mean prediction of the individual trees.
Dataset
We have used historical datasets of different companies for training and testing our models. These datasets provide information on stock prices over time, along with other relevant features.
